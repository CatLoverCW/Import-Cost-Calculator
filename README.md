# Import-Cost-Calculator
This was my first solo project as a student in my computer science class in secondary school, around 2-3 months after it began (started classes in September 2024, completed project in Novemeber 2024). This project's goal was to showcase our experience with HTML, CSS and hosting data on the cloud (specifically Firebase).

This whole project is pretty bad if you look at it through a lens of it being an actual tool to calculate the cost of importing something lolz, since its missing a lot of vital things that would make it realistically function without giving a wrong estimation to the user. But, as a way to demonstrate my programming skills after 2 months of me beginning to program, I think it's pretty good in that respect.

This shouldn't be used as an actual import cost calculator (obviously haha), I'm mainly just uploading this here to mark the beginning of were I started to program. I also think it'd be a great way to gauge the progress I've made with my programming ability and knowledge as they both improve :)

<-- DISCLAIMER -->

This project relies on a Firebase that contains the values for the cost of an item to be multiplied by. It really doesn't matter much since the user had to input this value manually and the firebase only displayed and revealed the values to the user. But if you want you could create a Firebase with the values for each different type of VAT and then paste its configuration. You could also just use the list below, which contains the VAT values below to multiply the cost of an item haha.

1.STANDARD = 23%
2.REDUCED = 13.5%
3.ZERO = 0% (duh)
